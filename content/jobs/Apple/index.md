The Objective was to detect cycles in the engine oil change data of vehicles using unsupervised Anomaly Detection techniques. Strategy and Impact:
- Applied LOWESS smoothing on various sensor data to remove noise, increase efficiency of algorithms and performed unsupervised feature selection using Deep Neural Network and bountiful visualizations
- Developed Autoencoder model to reconstruct features and get MAE which was further processed using sliding window of EWM average, Three-Sigma Limits and sliding window sum to detect anomalies
- Achieved 85% recall value on predicting anomalies in engine oil change cycle and <5% reconstruction error mean
