The Objective was to deliver an unsupervised Anomaly Detection model for real time health monitoring of the engine oil. Strategy and Impact:
- Applied LOWESS smoothing on various sensor data to remove noise, increase efficiency of algorithms and performed unsupervised feature selection using Deep Neural Network and bountiful visualizations
- Developed temporal probabilistic failure prediction model using Autoencoders with minimal false alarms
- Achieved 85% recall value on predicting anomalies in engine oil cycle and <5% reconstruction error mean
