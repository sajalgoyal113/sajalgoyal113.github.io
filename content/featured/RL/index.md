'***Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.***' ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

- Implemented Reinforcement Learning algorithm with CNN model as function approximator for Markov Decision Process where raw pixels of current state are input
- Incorporated Experience replay to reduce overfitting and reached human level accuracy with 10+ hours of training the Deep Q-network model
