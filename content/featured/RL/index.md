'***Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.***' ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

- Implemented Reinforcement Learning algorithm with CNN model as function approximator for Markov Decision Process where raw pixels of current state are input
- Used Experience replay to reduce overfitting thereby smoothing out and speeding up the training process
- Trained the Deep Q-network model for 10+ hours which reached Human level accuracy on an average
- Implemented model free network does not take internal features of emulator and outputs optimal action for each state
