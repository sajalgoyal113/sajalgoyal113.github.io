'***Explore The Unexplored.***'  

- Designed Detection and Tracking algorithm to detect complex objects and their centre under water using OpenCV
- Created multi-class labelled underwater dataset for training the State-of-the-Art real time object detection system
- Tweaked the vision layer in the codebase to complete image processing tasks meticulously while improving its robustness
