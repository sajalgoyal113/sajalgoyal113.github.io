'***You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.***'  ~ Dr. Seuss

- Pre-processed the Point cloud data, collected by Velodyneâ€™s Puck lidar sensor(VLP-16), in MATLAB to remove invalid points
- Implemented code to differentiate ground points while getting bounding boxes of different objects by DBSCAN algorithm
- Implemented robust tracking using Kalman filter optimally estimating the current state of the surrounding objects
