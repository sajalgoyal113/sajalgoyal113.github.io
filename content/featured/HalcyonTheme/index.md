'***If You're Not Paying For It, You Become The Product***' ~ Andrew Lewis

- Built NLP model which takes Tweet and Sentiment as input and outputs Part of Tweet which represents that Sentiment
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and stacked some layers on top of RoBERTa to increase robustness of the model
- Integrated a 5-fold cross validation using Stratified sampling to reduce overfitting and accomplished 0.715 jaccard score
