I have completed my B.Tech from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in the Dept. of Chemical Engineering in 2022. I enjoy exploring different products and reading blogs on topics including **Financial Markets** and **Product Growth**. I love to feed my brain with data and extract valuable patterns from it.
